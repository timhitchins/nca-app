              Sign up for mailing list Timeline of construction projects for
              people to see to understand where they can intervene in the
              process - from the time that the permit is approved to when ground
              is broken When does public notification happen? Do neighborhood
              associations get notified?
              https://www.portlandoregon.gov/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=414217 Make
              sure that people know that once a permit has been approved, the
              time to advocate/intervene has passed, but timeline can still
              serve for people to understand how to intervene and be aware of
              future projects.Help people understand how they can get notices of
              potential construction before it goes to the permitting process.
