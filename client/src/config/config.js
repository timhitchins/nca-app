      However, in the Portland metro area, the presence of fine and ultra-fine 
      particulate matter from older dirty diesel engines makes our air unhealthy. 
      <strong>Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties rank in the top 5 
      percent of all counties nationwide for ambient diesel particulate concentrations</strong> and have the highest exposure rate of all counties in Oregon.</span>`,
